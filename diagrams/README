# Network Topology Diagram

The network diagram illustrates the segmented virtual infrastructure deployed on Proxmox VE.

## Network Topology


Diagram Includes:

- Proxmox VE host
- pfSense virtual firewall/router
- WAN connection to home network
- VLAN 10 (Client Network)
- VLAN 20 (Domain Controller Network)
- DC1 and DC2 placement
- Windows 10 client placement
- Lubuntu client placement

The architecture enforces logical segmentation between client and identity networks while centralizing routing and policy control through a virtualized firewall appliance.
