# Network Design Overview

## Design Objectives

- Implement VLAN-based segmentation between client and server networks
- Prevent lab environment exposure to home network
- Centralize routing and firewall control
- Support DHCP relay to centralized identity services

---

## VLAN Structure

| VLAN | Purpose | Subnet |
|------|---------|--------|
| VLAN 1  | pfSense| 10.0.0.0/24
| VLAN 10 | Client Systems | 10.0.10.0/24 |
| VLAN 20 | Domain Controllers | 10.0.20.0/24 |

---

## Routing & Firewall Design

- pfSense deployed as virtual router/firewall
- WAN interface connected to home network
- NAT prevents lab exposure
- Firewall rules restrict unnecessary east-west traffic
- DHCP relay forwards client requests to domain controller

---

## Identity Placement Strategy

Domain controllers placed in isolated VLAN 20 to:

- Reduce attack surface
- Control access via firewall rules
- Simulate network segmentation practices
